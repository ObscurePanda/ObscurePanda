<body>Eric Monroe sat at a small, well worn table. He had a thermos of black coffee to his right. He liked to drink directly from his thermos over meticulously pouring the contents into a separate mug only to repeat the process in a few swallows. Before him lay scattered photos and documents. To his left sat a half empty pack of cigarettes and a lighter. His only source of light was the tiny desk lamp sitting a foot away.

Today had been long for Eric. Most days were long, but today this was especially true. He’d stepped on his direct flight to Louisiana from New York Internal National Airport at 3:45 AM. His flight had made very good time, and he was done with his entire travel ordeal by 8:00 am. He grabbed breakfast at the Silver Spoon, his favorite hole in the wall in New Orleans. By noon he was home. Noon had been hours ago.

Eric looked at his phone. It was nearly 3:45 again. He grumbled to himself and took a moment to stretch his legs. He stood, taking a cigarette and lighting it as he did. He paced while he mulled over what he’d seen. Dozens of photos and reports. All detailing a supposed string of attacks in the swamps outside of Lafeyette. Local news barely touched on the subject, but the locals were high strung.

Eric surveyed the ramshackle lodgings he kept for himself. The walls were mostly bare. A shotgun was hung by the door, garlic braids placed carefully over the windows, and every window had a silver charm embedded in the frame. When she died his great-grandmother had left him an antique, silver back mirror. It repelled vampires, werewolves, fey, and some demons. He caught sight of himself and took a moment to reflect.

Eric was 34, but he still looked like a man in his late 20s. His hair was thick and black. It was not woolen, nor was it straight and fine. Textured his mother liked to call it. His mother always told him he was half native, but when he looked in the mirror he didn’t see that. He saw a mildly sunburnt white man with bags under his eyes, a slight gut, and at least a week’s worth of beard growth on his cheeks. He wore a charcoal grey blazer, white shirt under and untucked. His mother would have shamed him if she new he was wearing dirty blue jeans and sneakers with a dress shirt.

He sighed and took a drag off his cigarette. Eric looked back down at his table with its myriad photos and police reports. A photo of a woman, gutted like a deer and split open just as wide, peeked out from under a police report detailing another woman’s encounter with, as she put it, a loup-garou while driving down parish road 305 where it cut through Bayou Chene. 

Eric stopped his pacing and walked to his table. He picked up that report and did his best to ignore the image sitting directly below it. He skimmed it over for what felt like the thousandth time that evening. According to the report the woman had been driving down the 305 at around 1:15 in the morning with her husband asleep in the passenger seat. She had seen a blur of something run across the road just beyond the illumination of her headlights, and then again from the corner of her eye. She said she could see if running just off the side of the road through the trees. At first she thought it was a large bird, but it was too late and too close to the ground and trees for that. Then after fifteen minutes she said she saw a man with glowing red eyes and a wicked, distended jaw standing right in front of her car, only to leap over the hood and land right on her roof a moment before she would have struck him. She had swerved, the report said, and the man fell off. She was lucky, it didn’t catch up.

There was a buzz coming from the table. Eric jumped and reached for the gun he typically kept at his hip. It wasn’t there, and for a moment he felt a twinge of panic before it dawned on him that his phone was ringing. He swore to himself and set the papers back down. Eric still owned a flip phone, an old Nokia. He kept it because it vibrated loud and hard enough for him to notice no matter how distracted he was.  He grabbed the phone, flipped it open, and looked at the name. Liberty Miller, his apprentice and one of the few women in the world willing to put up with him. Eric thought of her as one of the good ones. Liberty was smart, witty, and driven. Eric knew she’d go far.

“This is Jon,” he said a moment after pressing a bright, green button that bore a symbol resembling an old corded phone. His voice came out roughened from lack of sleep. Eric had always preferred to be called Jon. It was shorter, and he had a liking for monosyllabic names.

“Hey boss,” came the reply on the other end. “I just got to the Cornier place. Something ‘bout this place don’ sit right with me. You got the photos on you?” 

“Yeah, I got ‘em,” he said looking down at the table again. He didn’t want to look again and uttered a silent swear. He fished through his papers and quickly located the folder that photo had come from. He opened it, purposefully leaving the picture of the bodies, which he’d been staring at all day, on the table. If he didn’t absolutely have to he would not be looking at them again.

“Cool cool. Anything stick out to you?” She was far too awake and cheerful for what she was doing. That was part of how Liberty kept her sanity, she just kept smiling no matter how bad the things she saw got.

“Uhhh…” he flipped through them quickly. “A few things, I guess. Why do you ask?”

“Just curious, I guess. I’m standing outside on the porch.”

“You alone?” He asked trying to hide the worry in his voice.

“With a loup-garou running about? No. I brought Tyler with me.” Eric heard a quick conversation happening just beyond the receiver. Tyler looked like a run of the mill douchebag frat boy, but he was a good kid when you got to know him. Eric was not his biggest fan, but he was the kind of guy who’d have your back in a fight and that was precisely what Liberty would need in the event a worst case scenario happened. “Sorry, Tyler says the lock is jammed. We’ll have to go around back.”

“What makes him think the back door will be easier?”

“It’s glass and broken.” Eric was surprised by that. Whomever took the photos did a piss poor job. He knew that a scout with the Order of St. Francis had to be both discrete and fast, but that is the kind of thing you document. Newer members tended to operate on the belief that they were working in conjunction with detailed police reports. The truth was that anything the Order of St. Francis got into would rarely even have a police response, let alone a detailed report. Even those cases that did have a report left out a lot of details. Details often got removed or omitted entirely by officers in the pocket of creatures like the occasional demon or, as was more often the case, vampires.

“In or out?”

“Huh? Oh, uh… out,” she answered. Eric could hear something crunching in the background of their conversation. “Glass is everywhere. There’s a lot of blood out here… I think fur, too. Think it belonged to our loup-garou?”

“Maybe,” he answered, “but I am not convinced this is a werewolf.” Loup-garou was what the bayou folk called a werewolf. Eric always felt it sounded too low class. Cajuns had always been a salt of the earth people. Those who were distinctly not city bred and more aptly meant to live in the back woods where city folk thought everybody fucked their sisters and lynched black folk. Eric was guilty of that same prejudice. Eric always said werewolf.

“Why not,” she asked, her tone thick with confusion.

“Well,” he started, “for one the scene is too damn clean.”

“Clean,” she interrupted. “Jon, I can see from here the carpet is soaked through with blood. This place smells like a slaughterhouse, and not a clean slaughterhouse.”

“Well,” he said, shuffling the photographs he clutched and taking another drag off his cigarette, “take a step inside.”

“Alright,” Liberty said. “Now what?”

“Tell me what you see.” He said. This should have been obvious, he thought.

“You know, it might be easier next time to just ask me to take a quick look around. Ass.” Liberty was quiet for several long moments. “Ok. It’s real dark in here. The lights aren’t working, there is blood splattered all over the walls from what I can see. Looks like somebody got torn up real bad in here.” Eric took a moment to process what Liberty was seeing. The bodies had all been cleared out, but whomever had paid off the cops to keep this string of deaths quiet did even bother to let anybody clean the houses. Abandoned homes were not uncommon out in those swamps. Maybe, he thought, they assumed nobody will notice.

“Yeah. Ok. So, let’s take this as a moment to learn, shall we?” Eric searched around for his ashtray. He found it under a manilla folder marked “Forten Incident”. He pulled the ashtray closer to him and flicked off the growing ash end of his cigarette. He took another drag. “What did you not see, Liberty?” He made sure to stress the word not.

“Um… I dunno.” She said. Eric took a moment to consider if she really was unsure, or just didn’t want to think on it. She was still in her early twenties, barely old enough to drink. Eric decided he’d rather believe her ignorant than lazy.

“I’ve got the photos. They’re mostly of the bodies, but the few I do have of the house are lacking a lot of werewolf calling cards.” He picked up one of the photos; a wide shot of the living room. The room itself was still in good condition minus all the blood. “Turn on your flashlight if you haven’t already and really take a look around you. If that room wasn’t covered blood how would you describe it?”

“Well…” she said. Eric could picture Liberty standing there, phone to her ear, turning a slow circle and scanning the walls with her flashlight. “I guess… I guess it looks like a pretty typical home. I think someone that lived here was older. I see lots of those cute little baby angels with those inspirational quotes on them. You know, the ones that say things like ‘good friends’ or have a passage from the bible on them?” That gave Eric a smile. He pictured his mother for a moment and how she had enough of those figurines to fill a warehouse. He made a sound to indicate he knew precisely the angels she was talking about.

“Anything else?”


“I’m standing between what I think was the dining area and the kitchen. It looks like there is a little archway and then there is a living room. I can’t see in there, too dark. This place looks pretty untouched though.”

Eric rolled his head side to side until he felt it pop. He kept pulled off his cigarette while she spoke, interjecting with an occasional grunt of acknowledgement. He looked down at his thermos. He really wanted another mouthful of coffee or before too long he’d start to drift off. He decided he would act on his urge and set the phone to speaker.

“Exactly,” he said. He unscrewed the top to his thermos and took in a swallow of coffee. It was no longer hot, but it was still coffee. He pondered brewing another pot and emptying the rest of this thermos into the sink. He did so while he spoke. “So, you’ve got an untouched house with a pane of glass shattered outwards. The only way that could happen is if whatever did this was already in the house. Werewolves are capable of opening a door, sure, but you said the front door was still locked. If this was a werewolf attack then why is there a front door still?”

“Well, maybe it came in through the back.” She had a solid point. The longer Eric thought on it the more sense that made.

“Is it locked?”

“Is what locked,” Liberty said in a tone of voice that said her brain had to do a complete 180 from whatever she had just been pondering.

“That back door. The glass one. Werewolves have a lot of difficulty manipulating a door knob. Their claws are too big to get a firm hold and they rely on their talons to get a grip. And that is in the man-wolf form they take. So, for this to be a werewolf it would have had to be in that form. If it was fully wolf it would have burst the glass inwards to enter. If it were in the man form this is a lot less likely to happen. For a werewolf in man form to do this he’d have to have either been out on the prowl, or he’d have to have known these people and decided he wanted to kill them. This isn’t killing number one, so I am finding it hard to believe that someone would just let a stranger into their house after sundown.”

“Well, maybe he was out on the prowl, Jon.”

“Then why is the glass broken outwards?”

“Maybe he wanted to make a quick exit?” Eric could tell from the way her voice fluctuated that Liberty was in the middle of doing some physical activity. She grunted and continued. “Jesus, well, it flipped the couch in the living room. This place is a disaster area. Furnature flipped, TV looks like something slammed into it pretty hard. From the blood soaked into the carpet I’d wager somebody got thrown into it. Sure looks like a man sized object crashed into it.”

“And the back door?”

“I’m getting to it. I walked a bit further into the house while we chatted. Before you ask, Tyler is in the kitchen. So, no, I did not wander this house alone.” Eric believed her. Liberty was young and made bad choices like all twenty-somethings do. She was far from stupid though, and took the lesson to heart when Eric paid a man in a gorilla suit to jump out at her the last time she had wandered around completely alone to teach her a lesson. She learned, but not after she kicked Eric’s accomplice squarely in the testicles. “I learned my lesson after I nearly cost Bobby Gibson his left nut.” She laughed at the memory. So did Eric.

“Yeah, well, tell me what you find.” Eric said as he filled the resevoir in his now vintage Mr. Coffee. He rifled through the cabinet above his sink. He kept coffee, cereal, filters, and mugs all in that one cabinet. The room was quite dark with only his desk lamp to provide light, but he managed. He took out a filter and loaded it into his coffee maker. He measured out two even scoops of fine ground coffee. He stopped to really ponder that coffee. Would just two scoops be enough?

“Locked. It’s even got one of those hardware store dowels wedged between the door and the frame so you can’t break the lock and get in.” Eric noticed the tone of her voice change. “I don’t know why I didn’t notice this before, there is a big ass bag of dog food on the floor. It’s propped against the kitchen counter.”

“Probably where the fur and blood on the glass came from,” Eric said as he determined two scoops was certainly not enough and added two more. This time the scoops he took out heaped and he didn’t bother to level them off.

“Yeah, I guess so.” Eric could tell she was mulling something over in her head. “Alright,” she said, “I think I get where your line of thinking is going. Doors are all locked, back door is shattered outwards. Whatever went through did so with an impressive amount of force. The glass is everywhere in the back yard. So, whatever it was had to have been let in. That doesn’t mean we’re dealing with something other than a loup-garou though, Jon. I seen in the photos they got hangin up that there were kids here. I think teenagers. Maybe as old as their late teens to early twenties.” She spoke very matter of factly. Pondering the brutal murders of people close to her own age didn’t seem to phase Liberty in the slightest.

“It wasn’t a first change situation,” Eric said snapping his coffeemaker drip tray into place and setting it to brew. “Werewolf attacks are savage. A werewolf shifting into two tons of fur, fang, and claw for the first time… girl those attacks are worse.” Eric turned around and leaned against a battered counter top. “But talk it through with me. Tell me what you’re thinking.”

“Well… it’s bad. There is blood everywhere. It’s so thick that the carpet is… squishing with every step I take.” Eric stifled his chuckle. Liberty could handle bodies and blood on the walls effortlessly, but the carpet squishing below her feet was where she drew the line. “Hell, even threw the dog out the back door from what i gather you’re leading me too.”

“Yeah,” he said. “You’re right. But a werewolf,” he said, making sure to emphasize the word werewolf, “Would have eaten the dog. Not thrown it away like that. You also still haven’t caught the one thing that should be there, all over the place, if this had been a werewolf.” Eric heard his coffee beginning to drip and felt a smile hit his lips.

“Jesus Christ, fine. Just tell me what it is. I’m not finding anything in here anyway.”

“Well,” Eric said walking back to his table and finally picking up the photos of the bodies, “the bodies have been mostly eaten. The woman was split wide open and her entrails were pulled out. She was split like a deer. She’s got claw marks on her, but they are focused on her groin and throat. Werewolf would have just pinned her and started eating.” He flipped to another photo, this one worse. “The husband, his name was Jean from what I was told, was found in the living room. His throat was torn out. The wound is jagged and meat was ripped away from his neck down to his spine. Werewolves can do that. He was, however, found with his clothes in a bloody heap near his body. No werewolf would take the time to strip their victims. They just eat.”

“Yeah, ok. Go on,” she said. Eric could hear her eye roll.

“Both doors are locked tight. So whatever it was either got let in, or found a way into the house that didn’t involve busting through one of the doors or windows. Werewolves are smart, Liberty, but they still struggle with door knobs. The back door would have made sense, but since it was locked at the time and the glass was obviously broken by something being thrown through it we know that it didn’t get in that way.

“On top of all that, there’s not enough damage. Sure, shit’s broken. That’s all shit broken in the middle of a struggle though. That TV? Jean appears to have been thrown into it. His body was lying a foot or so away on the floor directly in front of that TV. Back door is shattered from a body being hurled through it. Nobody recovered a dog, but I would be genuinely surprised to discover that dog hadn’t been scavenged by gators or coons by the time whatever it was that ate that family left. Most importantly, the blood is mostly on the floor. Werewolves… they make a hell of a mess. True. But the mess they make gets everywhere. Add on to all this the fact that a werewolf is so big it can’t help clawing the shit out of walls and furniture while it attacks and you’ve got a recipe for a killing that isn’t caused by a werewolf.”

Eric spread a few more photos. He fell silent while he looked them over. Whatever had been doing this, and Eric was sure it wasn’t a werewolf, certainly had a method. Every single photo showed the same types of violence. Bodies chewed up and gutted, blood soaked carpets, and families. Every single attack had been on families. 

They all had children. One family had a newborn infant, another twin girls of 12. There were five families in all. The oldest, so far, appeared to be the most recent victims and whose home Liberty was currently investigating. There were the Cormiers. They had three children. Two were boys, the oldest being 16 and the younger being twelve, along with a daughter of 5. As Eric mulled these thoughts over a stroke of genius hit him.

“Liberty, they never found the children.” Eric said it so matter of factly. He’d joined the Order of St. Francis when he was just 17. Now, at age 34, nothing surprised him anymore. He took one final drag of his cigarette and tossed it into the sink. 

“Ok? Why does that matter? Werewolves can eat children… I guess teenagers, too.” Eric wasn’t sure if Liberty was being stubborn or if she truly couldn’t believe this was being caused by anything but a werewolf. Eric sighed into the receiver.

“Liberty,” Eric said massaging a temple, “I will gladly concede that, yes, a werewolf can eat a child. And, might I add, I appreciate that you stopped calling them loups-garou.” Eric thought to himself how werewolves, from what the order had gleaned, were in fact intelligent and most were in control of themselves even at the height of the full moon. He’d heard talk that only certain packs were man-eaters, but that was a thought for a different time. He continued, “Really, Liberty, I do. But they don’t. They will eat your flesh and chew your bones, just like a dog. This thing it chewed on people, it started to eat them. Started. It never finished.

“Werewolves finish their meals, Liberty.” Eric realized he was pacing. He was tired and nervous and now it was starting to show. The longer Eric talked to Liberty the more off the situation felt. He was hoping that Liberty, who did the actual looking around most of the time, would have something click in her head and be able to fill in the blanks. Eric was at a loss, so he remained silent for a long moment.

“Ok,” she relented, “you have a valid point there.”

“Thank you for playing along here. Not a werewolf, so what do you think it could be?” Eric heard the coffee maker beep twice. “Oh, hold on,” he exclaimed, “coffee’s done!” Eric had a terrible poker face, and even worse control over his tone. At that moment his voice was filled with a childlike glee usually reserved for Christmas morning and Halloween.

Eric put the phone on speaker and set it down on his kitchen counter. His home was not large. He lived in what might be considered the stereotypical bayou shack. He was lucky enough to have three rooms. He had his main area consisting of a pseudo kitchen, a small area sectioned off as a living room, and a general purpose space beside the kitchen area where he kept his work area. He also had a loft of sorts just large enough to accommodate his bed and enough spare floor space so that he could walk if need be, accessed by a rudimentary set of stairs. The crowning jewel, at least in Eric’s eyes, was the toilet. It wasn’t anything more than an attached outhouse, but it opened directly into the Bayou. Eric held the personal belief that he had personally produced enough night-soil to fertilize at least half the trees that stood like menacing sentinels in the area outside his home.

Eric grabbed his thermos off his all purpose table and rinsed it out. A couple years back Eric had a water tank installed. He could get clean water from the sink, a personal goal since he bought the place. He refilled his thermos with fresh, hot coffee. He whistled while he went through his routine. 

“Jon, your whistling is lovely, really.”  	Eric could hear his apprentice stifle a laugh. “But, in all seriousness, if not a werewolf… what? We’re not exactly in the area for it, but maybe a wendigo? They do tend to wander.”

“Nah,” he said after a moment, “you find me one wendigo that ever left scraps behind.” He thought on it and added, “besides, last I checked there hasn’t been a wendigo in this part of the country for at least 70 years.” Eric had an internal debate as he spoke. Does he want sugar this time? Does he need sugar?

“Fair point. Sasquatch? Those come out this far sometimes.”

“Nah,” he replied. He decided no sugar and finished up. He returned to his phone and turned the speaker setting off. “Sasquatch aren’t aggressive like this. They will attack, and sometimes even eat you. But they won’t do… this. Besides, that still doesn’t explain how it got in. No one, not no one, gonna let a sas in.”

“Wait! A grunch! Grunch drink blood and eat flesh! They don’t need to be let in, either. Those little shits like to jump through mirrors.” Eric thought on that for a minute. He took a swallow of coffee. It was still too hot and he had to fight his urge to spit it out. He swallowed it with a twinge of pain.

“Hot!” He exclaimed. There was more stifled laughter from Liberty. “You hush your mouth. Why, I could have died that was so hot.” Eric realized he was smiling. He hadn’t smiled in three days. This was a welcomed reprieve from the gore he’d been trying to process. “Go check for broken mirrors. Grunch are lesser faeries. They can do the mirror trick, but the mirror will shatter when they do. They’re not exactly the smartest, but they are clever. Check the bathrooms first.That’s the place they would be most likely to come through.”

“Yeah. I think Tyler might have already been through that way.” Eric grunted in acknowledgement. “God damn it, where did he get to…”

“Wait,” he said. “You lost Tyler?” Eric was willing the fear out of his voice. If he could wait till Liberty was in her car, or at least outside, before it broke through this would much more smoothly. “You know the protocol. Make your way to the nearest path of egress. Report to me anything that isn’t right.”

“Yeah, I know. I’m gonna kill him when he pokes his head back out here.” Eric realized he was pacing. Without thinking he lit another cigarette. He looked down at the battered table currently serving as his work station. Every single body took on the appearance of Liberty and Tyler. Their already butchered faces morphed before his eyes to become vivid, screaming images. He saw the places where each victim had been chewed, clawed, and torn. If Tyler wasn’t just in the back of the house that would be Liberty.

“Are you even listening to me?” Liberty said, an obvious overtone of frustration in her voice. Eric realized she was talking the entire time he had been staring down at his desk. He mumbled out an apology, though he still found it hard to pull his eyes away from the photographs in front of him. “Seriously? Ass,” she continued, “I said I just noticed that the electricity is on, it’s just the lights aren’t working.”

“Huh? What do you mean?” He asked.

“Well, ok, don’t be mad. I stopped in the kitchen and just happened to glance off in the corner. They’ve got this coffee maker, right? And, I just noticed that the little clock thing is on.”

“Could be battery powered. That house isn’t on the most stable power grid.” Fuck.

“Yeah, I thought that too. So I checked some other things. The fridge is running, too. Oven works… it’s just the lights.”

“Hold on a moment,” he said, shuffling through reports. “I want to check something. Tell me if you hear anything.” Eric quickly skimmed over every report. Nothing mentioned any issues with the electricity. Everything else matched up, but so far as he could tell nobody commented that they couldn’t turn on the lights in the homes. He looked for the times people called the check on their neighbors, when the police initially entered the homes. Most took place during the middle of the day, but in a couple instances the police had entered in the early evening. 

“Well, this is distressing,” he said. “Nowhere else had that problem. Most of the time the police investigated during the day, but I see a couple reports here from people who called after dark because they’d stumbled upon a mangled neighbor saw smashed windows and called to report something. Lights not functioning would have been mentioned.”

Eric sat down again, panic making him light headed. He swallowed hard. Liberty, for all her rough and tumble bad-assery, was still very new. Eric was very much aware of his own heart beat. The rhythmic pounding like thunder in his ears. He felt like the entire world had fallen away around him, and he was left totally alone in a thunderous void with nothing but a chair, a table, and countless photos and reports of grizzly murder.

“Shit,” he heard Liberty say. A heartbeat later and all that came through were screams. Eric sat frozen. His mouth was open and eyes wide in an expression of shock and terror. He’d heard Liberty scream. He’d heard Tyler scream. Whatever was making those sounds wasn’t them, and it wasn’t human. He regained his composure just enough to think to himself tell her to run! Tell her to fucking run! With a clamor the line disconnected.

Eric sat in silence, bringing his phone into his line of site. The call screen flashed call time 13:22. There was a thumbnail featuring Liberty’s smiling face flashing in the center of the screen. Formerly an image that brought a smile to Eric’s face, now his mind distorted that once beautiful, dark skinned face into an eyeless, chewed up horror. Just as quickly the call time cycle finished, and Eric was looking at his home screen. He let his phone slip from his hand and he wept.
