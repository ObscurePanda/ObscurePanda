Rabi’a keeps pets, exclusively cats, and goes as far as to mummify them when they die and, though this may be for personal amusement, reanimate their corpses in dark, necromantic rituals to remain by her side even in death. She lights her haven with oil lamps and candles, burns frankincense and myrrh, and wears traditional linen clothing.</td>

<tr>
  <th>Appearance</th>
  <td colspan="3">Rabi’a is as beautiful as is possible for such an unhealthy, deathly-looking creature. Her skin has taken on the ashen translucence of a cancer patient. Her face is gaunt, eyes sunken, cheeks hollow. Her eyes have deep, dark circles beneath them at all times, and her lips, once full and red, appear bruised and blue like a corpse. Her veins show faintly through her paper-thin skin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Personality</th>
  <td colspan="3">Rabi’a is a dour, obsessive creature. She desperately clings to the few aspects of her mortal life she can. Rabi’a keeps pets, exclusively cats, and goes as far as to mummify them when they die and, though this may be for personal amusement, reanimate their corpses in dark, necromantic rituals to remain by her side even in death. She lights her haven with oil lamps and candles, burns frankincense and myrrh, and wears traditional linen clothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Sect Allegiance</th>
  <td colspan="3">Rabi’a is officially, and personally, a member of neither the Camarilla nor the Sabbat. She is an independent and aligns herself with the dominant sect in a given region. In Sabbat lands, she declares herself a panders or as a particularly morbid Serpent of the Light. Occasionally, while in heavily Sabbat-controlled regions, she will declare herself a Harbinger of Skulls and demand to meet her local kin. When she enters a Camarilla city, she almost always calls herself a Toreador or one of the African Liabon, namely the Mla Watu. Rabi’a rarely visits Elysium and only does so to meet her new prince or to contact local kindred. The Giovanni in any Camarilla city rarely see or meet her. Rabi’a does not like Giovanni, and she doesn’t hide it. This has nothing to do with the usury of her clan, stemming rather from intense personal dislike of Augustus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>History</th>
  <td colspan="3">Rabi’a was thought to be the first and only child of Lazarus during his self-imposed exile. He saved her, after all. History has recorded, according to a scant few elders, that a girl by the name of Angelique was the only survivor of a plague-ravaged Coptic Monastery. A vampire named Lazarus, so the story goes, found her and, upon seeing her speaking to the corpses of the monks, embraced the sickly girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <td colspan="3">Parts of the story are true. To casual observation, a temple had been decimated by a mysterious fast-spreading plague. A single, deathly ill young woman was the only survivor. A creature named Lazarus did find her, and he did “save” her. There is more there, though. He saved her from Rabi’a, the errant child of his brother Caias Koine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <td colspan="3">Over the years, Rabi’a grew close to and became so greatly attached to her adopted "sire" that her near parasitic need for him could be construed as love in the right eye. Her devotion to her was so great that she would follow his every command with great zeal. She seemed almost an obedient bitch to his masculine alpha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <td colspan="3">Years passed, and she studied silently by his side, or was sent off to the far reaches of Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia to gather some occult text, or maintain one of her sire’s (and eventually her own) varied contacts, both mortal and immortal alike.</td>
</tr>
    <tr>
  <th></th>
  <td colspan="3">For centuries this was her life. Lazarus would send her off, or she would wander off (as her sire encouraged her to travel and study) to Europe, a place she greatly enjoyed, and intermingle with the kindred of the north. She studied for many years among the Romans and actively sought out mortal sorcerers and magi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">While not prone to adventure, she did certainly have her fair share. Her life showed great and sudden bouts of activity, often, if not exclusively, in the effort to get her hands on some obscure artifact, scrolls, or piece of lore. She had charm enough or intelligence enough to procure nearly anything she sought after given enough time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">Eventually, she found that Lazarus had fallen to torpor, and Rabi’a, now alone without her beloved sire, found herself forced to entertain her own pursuits. Those pursuits followed along a strange and meandering path influenced greatly by the religious conflict in the area. Just before the end of the Long Night, she stumbled upon an artifact in the ruins of a Sumerian temple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">She returned to Egypt and had her childer scribe what she found, among them an obscure codex. Given the secluded, distant location of these ruins, Rabi’a never brought the artifact back. She hoped Lazarus, obsessed with omnipotence, would never learn of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">In an event that shaped the very history of the clan and in part all of the Camarilla, Lazarus woke up, and he discovered what his child had found. He demanded she retrieve this codex, and Rabi’a sent out one of her childer to abscond with it. Rabi’a never held her sire's beliefs that one could unlock the powers of the gods with a mere tablet; even still, when her childe returned with the Sargon Codex, she dealt him final death and broke the relic. She lied to Lazarus and told him the errant child had broken it and lost a fragment along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">While Lazarus studied what he had, Rabi’a hastily traveled to the far eastern reaches of the Roman Empire. She gave her fragment to an ally there and demanded to never be told of its fate. The creature who accepted it wished not to know what it was, for it spoke to him, and he snatched it from her readily. Rabi’a was pleased, for in the hands of such a kindred she felt the tablet would remain safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">She returned to Egypt to find her had fallen into torpor once more. Rabi’a, perhaps out of longing to be with him always, retreated to her crypt and let the sleep of ages take her as well. As she lay there, her ally in the north grew mad, and in his madness, he finally succumbed to the final death; his Lamia servant his only company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">For a century, the fragment lay with the ashes of that mad Cappadocian untouched by the hands of any but his Lamia. When it was discovered by an errant, young member of the Giovanni family, Rabi’a awoke with a shock. She had enchanted, though some say cursed, the object and when Markus first laid hands upon it, Rabi’a was wrenched from her slumber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">She reached through the ethereal to speak to the poor Giovanni through the fragment he carried. She called to him, bade him to journey through the desert to the shining jewel of Cairo, where Lazarus and his brood of mindless followers made their home. As he journeyed towards Rabi’a, the call grew stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">Through Constancia’s assault on her sire's haven, she was able to sneak the codex away and deposit it, indirectly, back into the hands of Markus. She did not care what he did with it; Rabi’a knew that the Giovanni family would never decipher the meaning of the codex, nor would they find Lazarus' bizarre interpretation of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">The conflict itself was violent. Rabi’a stepped aside as Constancia and her minions invaded the crypt. The two had always had a tenuous relationship at best. Neither agreed with the overall beliefs of the other, but both respected each other's own unique brilliance. This respect did not extend to the Lazarenes or Lazarus himself. Through the extension of a major boon, Rabi’a convinced Constancia to kill as few and destroy as little as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">As Constancia and Markus destroyed her home, Rabi’a retreated to Cairo. She took up residence in the necropolis outside the city. Much like the monks who captured Erciyes, Rabi’a, once driven to a prolonged burst of action, fell back into her docile, quiet ways. She roused herself from long periods of research and experimentation between brief reflective periods of torpor only long enough to retrieve her precious scrolls, artifacts, and relics from her former haven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">For a full century, she contentedly sat in the city of Cairo's dead. Her sire had vanished, leaving Rabi’a's scroll of Papyrus as the only evidence he had ever been there. He briefly explained that he was gone, and she'd feel him call when the time came; so she just waited there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">By the late 13th century, Rabi’a felt a pull. With vain, desperate hope her sire was calling to her, she traveled to Northern England. Lazarus was not there. He had never been there, but Constancia had, and she left a ghoul to greet Rabi’a. Nobody knows what news was delivered to her*, but the next night, she had returned to Cairo. Within a month, the Cappadocian presence in Cairo had been cut so low only a half dozen of them remained**.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">Rabi’a herself stayed in the Cairene necropolis until the very end of the 20th Century. While in Cairo, she called herself "Angelique". For nearly 800 years, Rabi’a's only real company was a single ghoul created during her journey to England. She ventured away from Cairo often, though Prince Mukhtar never noticed. Even though she traveled, after the purge of 1444, Rabi’a refused to leave the Middle East.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">When the Giovanni finally did come to Cairo, Rabi’a reacted with unusual force, raising century's old corpses in a direct attempt to strong-arm the Prince into banishing them from the city. Eventually, they reached an agreement. Mukhtar Bey would keep the Giovanni out, and Rabi’a would keep him informed. So far, the two seem to be holding up their own respective end of the bargain. The Giovanni family is still banned from Cairo, and Mukhtar Bey knows a little bit more about Cainite history.</td>

While the Infitriores (or Lazarene Cappadocians) who settled in Jamaica and Haiti eventually spawned the Samedi, those poor Cappadocians who fled to Portugal fell, by and large, to the fangs of the Giovanni.</td>
